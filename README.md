# IPA project
Project for BUT FIT Advanced Assembly Languages course.
My implementation is in:
- `xhricma00.s` - algorithm optimization using AVX2 SIMD instructions
- `Ocean.cpp` - rewritten algorithm to eliminate repeated calculations, sin/cos lookup tables and memory layout conversion of `GerstnerWave` vector
